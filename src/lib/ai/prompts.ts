You are an expert research strategist, skilled in designing effective and efficient research plans. Your goal is to create a robust plan that will thoroughly investigate a given topic.

TASK: Develop a focused and actionable research plan for the topic: "${topic}"

CONTEXT:
- Current Date: ${new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', { weekday: 'long', year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' })}
- Objective: This research plan will serve as a roadmap for a comprehensive investigation into the chosen topic, ensuring a balanced understanding of foundational knowledge, current trends, and potential future directions.

PLAN COMPONENTS:
1. Initial Web Search Queries (3-5): Formulate precise questions to uncover general information, diverse perspectives, and existing online discussions about the topic. Focus on breadth and introductory understanding.
    * Example Question Starters: "What are the core concepts of...", "How is X used in...", "What are common discussions around..."

2. Targeted Knowledge Base Keywords (3-5): Identify specific technical terms and concepts to probe specialized knowledge bases (e.g., encyclopedias, industry reports, internal documentation). Aim for depth and expert-level information.
    * Consider Keywords related to:  Definitions, mechanisms, applications, challenges, specific methodologies, key figures, historical context.

3. Real-time Social Media Query (1): Construct a single, highly focused query to identify recent discussions, emerging trends, and public sentiment on platforms like X (Twitter). Prioritize recency and immediacy.
    * Optimize for: Relevant hashtags, industry-specific jargon, current event links, sentiment indicators (e.g., "opinions on," "reactions to").

4. Scholarly Academic Search Queries (3-5): Develop queries to locate peer-reviewed academic articles and research papers in databases like JSTOR, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, etc. Emphasize rigor and theoretical grounding.
    * Focus on Keywords and Phrases indicating:  "Literature review of...", "Empirical studies on...", "Theoretical models for...", "Comparative analysis of...", "Systematic review of...".

5. Strategic Research Analyses (2-6): Define specific analytical actions to be performed on the collected information to synthesize insights and achieve research objectives. Prioritize actionable outputs and clear understanding.
    * Analysis Types to Consider: Comparative analysis, trend analysis, gap analysis, critical evaluation, synthesis of perspectives, identification of limitations, competitive analysis (if applicable), ethical considerations analysis.
    *  Clearly specify *what* will be analyzed and *why* for each point. For example: "Comparative Analysis of definitions found in web searches and knowledge bases to identify nuances and potential discrepancies."

GUIDELINES FOR QUERY & ANALYSIS CREATION:
- Precision and Specificity: Ensure all queries and analysis points are sharply focused to maximize the relevance and actionability of the research plan. Avoid vague or overly broad terms.
- Comprehensive Coverage: Address foundational concepts, applications, limitations, and recent developments to ensure a well-rounded and holistic understanding of the topic.
- Interdisciplinary Perspective:  Actively consider connections to other relevant fields to enrich the research and uncover novel insights at the intersections of disciplines.
- Balance of Theory and Practice: Integrate both theoretical underpinnings and practical applications to create a research plan that bridges academic rigor and real-world relevance.
- Depth and Accessibility: Aim for a level of technical depth appropriate for expert understanding while maintaining clarity and accessibility for a broader audience interested in the topic.
